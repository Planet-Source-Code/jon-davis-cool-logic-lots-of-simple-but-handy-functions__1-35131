## Cool Logic \(Lots of simple but handy functions\)


</div>

### Description

These are some functions that I use all the time that Microsoft left out of core VB. Some of them are more useful than others, like IsEven()/IsOdd() and IsLeapYear() and PlaySound() and SaveString() and GetPathDir(). Some of this source is borrowed and modified from other authors' sources, but at least half of it is original. I have rewritten this code to put it into a class module, and then I compiled it to a DLL. I use the DLL all the time in projects. Very handy!
